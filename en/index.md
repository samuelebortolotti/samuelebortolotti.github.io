# Welcome
I am Samuele Bortolotti and I am currently attending University of Trento for a Master's Degree in Computer Science, where I earned a Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science in 2021.

My university studies have mainly focused on programming, machine learning, computer vision and data science. I enjoy learning new things regardless of their subject matter, however I particularly enjoy history and information technology. 

On this web page you can find the contact details of my main social networks, my curriculum vitae, the projects I have carried out and those I am currently working on.

You can contact me by writing to me either in English, Italian or German. I am currently trying to improve my knowledge of German, so I kindly ask you to be patient with any misunderstanding.
