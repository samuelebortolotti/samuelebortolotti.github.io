# Welcome

I am Samuele Bortolotti, a Ph.D. candidate in Computer Science at the University of Trento, [Structured Machine Learning Group](https://sml.disi.unitn.it/), under the supervision of [Stefano Teso](https://stefanoteso.github.io/) and [Andrea Passerini](https://disi.unitn.it/~passerini/index.html). My research focuses on explainable AI, shortcut learning, and neuro-symbolic machine learning.

My academic background revolves around programming and machine learning. I have a strong interest in nearly all aspects of programming, including distributed systems, web architectures, databases, and parallel programming. More recently, I have been exploring trustworthiness in machine learning—specifically, how models learn from data, where they may fail, and how neuro-symbolic AI can enhance their reliability.

I earned my Bachelor's and Master's degrees (cum laude) in Computer Science from the University of Trento in 2021 and 2023, respectively.

On this page, you will find my contact details, CV, and an overview of my recent publications.

Feel free to reach out in English, Italian, or German. As I’m still improving my German, I appreciate your patience with any misunderstandings.
