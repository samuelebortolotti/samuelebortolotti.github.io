# Welcome

I am Samuele Bortolotti, currently pursuing my Ph.D. studies in Computer Science within the TANGO Horizon EUROPE RIA project at the University of Trento's [Structured Machine Learning Group](https://sml.disi.unitn.it/), under the supervision of [Andrea Passerini](https://disi.unitn.it/~passerini/index.html) and [Stefano Teso](https://disi.unitn.it/~teso/). My main research interests involve explainable artificial intelligence, interactive machine learning, and neuroâ€‘symbolic machine learning with the aim of making deep learning models more explainable.

My university studies have mainly focused on programming, machine learning, computer vision and data science. I have developed a profound appreciation for various facets of programming, encompassing almost everything from distributed software programming, web architectures, database management, parallel programming and more. However, in the last two years, my curiosity has led me to explore different topics such as algorithm optimization, statistical methods, quantum machine learning, and most importantly, explainable artificial intelligence, interactive machine learning, and neuro-symbolic artificial intelligence. I earned a Bachelor's and a Master's degree (cum laude) from the University of Trento in in Computer Science in 2021 and 2023, respectively.

On this web page you can find the contact details of my main social networks, my curriculum vitae, and delve into both my completed and ongoing projects.

You can contact me by writing to me either in English, Italian or German. I am currently working on improving my German, so I kindly ask you to be patient with any misunderstanding.
